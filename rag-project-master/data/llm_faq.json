The video URL should be posted in the announcements channel on Telegram & Slack before it begins. Also, you will see it live on the DataTalksClub YouTube Channel. Don’t post your questions in chat as it would be off-screen before the instructors/moderators have a chance to answer it if the room is very active.",

If you missed that deadline, just sign up manually (or via request tech demo link) and use the chat to request for free hours for 'llm zoomcamp'. Issue: I’m a pre-existing user from a different zoomcamp and I’m not awarded the free hours even though I’ve submitted my email in the form. Answer: Just request it via their chat, after you’ve logged in using your pre-existing account, citing 'llm zoomcamp'.",

Some might have restrictions on what you can and cannot install, so be sure to read what is included in a free vs paid tier.",

First field is your nickname/displayed-name, change it if you want to be known as your Slack username or Github username or whatever nickname of your choice, if you want to remain anonymous. Unless you want 'Lucid Elbakyan' on your certificate, it is mandatory that you change the second field to your official name as in your identification documents - passport, national ID card, driver’s license, etc. This is the name that is going to appear on your Certificate!",

The reason is you need to peer-review 3 capstone(s) after submitting your own project. You can only peer-review projects at the time the course is running; after the form is closed and the peer-review list is compiled.",
