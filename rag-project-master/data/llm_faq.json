In that case, you can try inserting this line -e \"ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m\". This reduces the resource usage.

For example, you can create a new file named “api_keys.yml” in your repository. Then, do not forget to add it in your .gitignore file: #api_keys api_keys.yml You can now fill your api_keys.yml file: OPENAI_API_KEY: “sk[...]” GROQ_API_KEY: “gqk_[...]” Save your file. You will need the pyyaml library to load your yaml file, so run this command in your terminal: pip install pyyaml Now, open your jupyter notebook. You can load your yaml file and the associated keys with this code: import yaml # Open the file with open('api_keys.yml', 'r') as file: # Load the data from the file data = yaml.safe_load(file) # Get the API key (Groq example here) groq_api_key = data['GROQ_API_KEY'] Now, you can easily replace the “api_key” value directly with the loaded values without loading your environment variables.",
