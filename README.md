## About
SlackademicAdvisor-RAG is designed to streamline the onboarding process for students taking the LLm-Zoomcamp course. The LLM-Zoomcamp course repository includes a dedicated FAQ section with numerous subsections per module to address questions, alongside a vibrant Slack channel where daily discussions and queries take place. SlackademicAdvisor-RAG leverages these two data sources—FAQ and Slack channel data—to create a vector document that serves as a comprehensive base/ground-truth for answering any questions that new or existing students might have.

## Features
- Integration of FAQ data from the LLM-Zoomcamp course repository.
- Collection of questions and discussions from the Slack channel.
- Creation of a vector document for efficient question-answering.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate responses to student queries.
- Monthly updates and indexing of new data based on `DataTalksClub #slack-dump`.
